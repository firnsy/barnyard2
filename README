2. DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Barnyard2 is an open source interpreter for Snort unified2 binary output files.
Its primary use is allowing Snort to write to disk in an efficient manner and
leaving the task of parsing binary data into various formats to a separate
process that will not cause Snort to miss network traffic.

Barnyard2 has 3 modes of operation: 
  1. batch (or one-shot), 
  2. continual, and 
  3. continual w/ bookmark.  
  
In batch (or one-shot) mode, barnyard2 will process the explicitly specified
file(s) and exit.

In continual mode, barnyard2 will start with a location to look and a specified
file pattern and continue to process new data (and new spool files) as they
appear.

Continual mode w/ bookmarking will also use a checkpoint file (or waldo file in
the snort world) to track where it is. In the event the barnyard2 process ends
while a waldo file is in use, barnyard2 will resume processing at the last
entry as listed in the waldo file.

The "-f", "-w", and "-o" options are used to determine which mode barnyard2
will run in.  It is legal for both the "-f" and "-w" options to be used on the
command line at the same time, however any data that exists in the waldo file
will override the command line data from the "-f" and "-d" options. See the
command directives section below for more detail.

Barnyard2 processing is controlled by two main types of directives: input
processors and output plugins. The input processors read information in from a
specific format ( currently the spo_unified2 output module of Snort ) and 
output them in one of several ways.

Examples:

  1. Using barnyard2 in continuous mode with a waldo file

    # ./barnyard2 -c /etc/barnyard2.conf -d /var/snort -f snort.u2 -w /var/snort/snort.waldo

  2. Using barnyard2 in batch mode

    # ./barnyard2 -c /etc/barnyard2.conf -o file1.u2 file2.u2 file3.u2
